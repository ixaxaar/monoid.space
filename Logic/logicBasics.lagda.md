# Constructing Boolean algebra using type theory

Here we look at constructing logic using type theory.

```agda
module Logic.logicBasics where

open import Agda.Primitive using (Level; _⊔_; lsuc; lzero)
```

## Objects of Logic

### Empty / False

Type with no object - cannot ever create an object of this type. This makes it possible to define absurd functions, which map `⟂` to anything, as given nothing, one can create anything. Looking at it from a different angle, assuming any `False` statement can serve as a proof for anything, which is absurd.

```agda
data ⟂ : Set where
```

Absurd can imply anything, be it true or not. Thus, any statement can be proven using absurdity.

However, it is impossible to create an object of absurd type (as `⟂` has no constructor) and hence these functions make no sense in the "real world", as in they can never be invoked.


### Singleton / True

Set with only one object: `True`.

```agda
data ⊤ : Set where
  singleton : ⊤
```

We also have another representation of boolean objects, [Bool](./Types.dataStructures.html#boolean-type).

```agda
open import Lang.dataStructures using (Bool; true; false)
```

## Operations on these objects

### Negation or the logical `NOT`

We use the fact that a negation of a proposition `P` (to exist and be true) implies `¬ P` has to be false, `⟂`.

```agda
¬ : ∀ {a} → Set a → Set a
¬ P = P → ⟂
```

for our other representation:

```agda
not : Bool → Bool
not true = false
not false = true
```

### Product, conjunction `∧` or the logical `AND`

The logic `AND` and `OR` are pretty straightforward for both representations:

```agda
data _∧_ (A B : Set) : Set where
  AND : A → B → A ∧ B

infixr 4 _∧_
```

similarly:

```agda
_&&_ : Bool → Bool → Bool
true && x = x
false && x = false

infixr 4 _&&_
```

### Co-product, disjunction or the logical `OR`

```agda
data _∨_ (A B : Set) : Set where
  inj1 : A → A ∨ B
  inj2 : B → A ∨ B

infixr 4 _∨_
```

```agda
_||_ : Bool → Bool → Bool
true || x = true
false || x  = false

infixr 4 _||_
```

## Higher-order operations

These higher-order operations are built by composing the lower ones in various ways:

### Implication

Implication, or `if P then Q`, is derived from the well-known construction

$$
a ⟹ b = ¬ a ∨ b
$$

```agda
data _⟹_ (A B : Set) : Set where
  it⟹ : (¬ A) ∨ B → A ⟹ B
```

```agda
impl : Bool → Bool → Bool
impl x y = (not x) || y
```

Notice how the two implementations are different: `⟹` is constructive, whereas `impl` is computatational.

### The exclusive or or `XOR`

```agda
data _⨁_ (A B : Set) : Set where
  ⨁₁ : A → B → (A ∨ B) ∧ (¬ (A ∧ B)) → A ⨁ B
```

```agda
xor : Bool → Bool → Bool
xor x y = (x || y) && (not (x && y))
```

### Absurd

The absurd pattern for proving `Whatever`, we discussed [above](#empty--false):

```agda
⟂-elim : ∀ {w} {Whatever : Set w}
        → ⟂ → Whatever
⟂-elim ()
```

### Contradiction

A proposition `P` can always be true `⊤` if `¬ P` is always false `⟂`. If one were to assume a contradictory proposition `P`, one could prove anything as a contradiction makes `P` absurd. This is called as "ex falso quodlibet" or "from falsity, whatever you like". We can `⟂-elim` it in such a way to prove this:

```agda
contradiction : ∀ {p w} {P : Set p} {Whatever : Set w}
        → P
        → ¬ P
        → Whatever
contradiction p (¬p) = ⟂-elim (¬p p)
```

### Contraposition

Consider two propositions, `A` and `B`. Now if `A → B` is true, then `¬ A → ¬ B` will be true. In other words, if a statement `A` always implies another `B`, then `B` not being true would imply `A` not being true. This is called a contraposition and is proven in the following manner:

```agda
contrapos : ∀ {a b} {A : Set a}{B : Set b}
        → (A → B)
        → ¬ B → ¬ A
contrapos f ¬b a = contradiction (f a) ¬b
```

### Boolean construction

We can obviously go ahead now and implement the `if-then-else` semantic:

```agda
if_then_else_ : {A : Set} -> Bool -> A -> A -> A
if true  then x else y = x
if false then x else y = y

-- a more pythonic style `P ? if_true : if_false` (with universe polymorphism)
_then_else_ : ∀ {a} {A : Set a} -> Bool -> A -> A -> A
true then x else y = x
false then x else y = y
```

Note again that since this is a computational semantic, we provide implementation for only the concrete type `Bool`.

### Existential Quantification

Existential Quantification, or better known as "there exists" or `∃`, essential indicates if a proposition can exist:

```agda
data ∃ {A : Set} (P : A → Set) : Set where
  exists : {x : A}
        → P x
        → ∃ P
```

### Dependent proposition type

This is a dependent type, which creates propositions from a proposition family `P`:

```agda
∏ : {A : Set}(P : A -> Set) -> Set
∏ {A} P = (x : A) → P x
```
