# Groups and family

```agda
module Algebra.groups where

open import Types.typeBasics using (Σ; _,_)
```

In mathematics, particularly in algebra, a "group" is an abstract structure with mappings between them that preserve that structure. These abstractions happen to be of immense usefulness from modeling certain phenomenon in physics to patterns in computer science. We have different classes or subtypes of groups, some with stronger conditions and some with weaker. Group-like structures can be thought of to be generated by varying which ones from a bunch of laws we choose to apply i.e. totality, `associativity`, `identity`, `iverse` and `commutativity`.

## Semigroup

A semigroup is an object consisting of a set of type, say `T` and an operation `⋅` such that `⋅` is associative:

```agda
isSemigroup : {Type : Set} → Type → Type
isSemigroup A =
```
