# Debugging Agda

```agda
{-# OPTIONS --allow-unsolved-metas #-}

module Lang.debugging where

open import Agda.Builtin.Nat
```

Debugging and tooling are arguably the most vital parts of the development process and a language ecosystem. Tools tend to help developers figure out issues and assist them in the entire process. Agda has a small set of indispensable tools for such purposes. We look at how to use some of them to make our lives easier.

## Holes

The agda compiler supports type checking and providing hints while writing code. Unknown types can be represented with a placeholder `?` and the compiler can help deduce the type.

```agda
data _even : Nat → Set where
  ZERO : zero even
  STEP : ∀ x → x even → suc (suc x) even

proof₁ : suc (suc (suc (suc zero))) even
proof₁ = ?
```
The agda compiler hints the `?` should be `4 even`. This placeholder `?` is called a **hole**.

## Features

Agda supports various `Interaction` commands to provide several features via the `agda --interaction` command. This implements a client-server protocol whereby a client can communicate with the agda compiler to do various tasks on the source files.

Agda supports the following commands:

### Global commands

| Name | Description | Internal name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| load | Load a file and type check it. | `Cmd_Load` |
| compile | compile a file using the various agda backends (`GHC`, `GHCNoMain`, `LaTeX`, `QuickLaTeX` etc) | `Cmd_compile` |
| abort | abort the current operation, do nothing otherwise | `Cmd_abort` |
| toggle-display-of-implicit-arguments | | `ToggleImplicitArgs` |
| show-constraints | Show constraints or goals | `Cmd_constraints` |
| solve-constraints | Solve all constraints in a file | `Cmd_solveAll` |
| show-goals | Show all goals in a file | `Cmd_metas` |
| search-about | Search about a keyword | `Cmd_search_about_toplevel` |

### Goal-specific commands

| Name | Description | Internal name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| why-in-scope | Explain why a keyword is in scope | `Cmd_why_in_scope` |
| infer-type | Infer type | `Cmd_infer` |
| module-contents | List all module contents | `Cmd_show_module_contents` |
| compute-normal-form | Compute the normal form of either selected code or given expression | `Cmd_compute` |

### Commands working in the context of a specific goal

| Name | Description | Internal name |
| --- | --- | --- |
| give | Fill a goal | `Cmd_give` |
| refine | Refine. Partial give: makes new holes for missing arguments | `Cmd_refine_or_intro` |
| auto | Automatic proof search, find proofs | `Cmd_auto` |
| case | pattern match on variables (case split) | `Cmd_make_case` |
| goal-type | Goal type | `Cmd_goal_type` |
| context | Context of the goal | `Cmd_context` |
| goal-type-and-context | Type and context of the goal | `Cmd_goal_type_context` |
| goal-type-and-inferred-type | Infer goal type and the context of the goal | `Cmd_goal_type_context_infer` |


## Text editor support

The interaction commands mentioned above can be tied to text editors and IDEs to provide additional assistance for programmers. Such integrations exist for the following text editors:

- Emacs - developed first, has tightest integration [Emacs mode](https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/v2.5.2/tools/emacs-mode.html)
- Atom - [agda-mode](https://atom.io/packages/agda-mode)
- VSCode - [vscode-agda](https://github.com/freebroccolo/vscode-agda)
- vim - [agda-vim](https://github.com/derekelkins/agda-vim)

There is discontinued support for [sublime](https://github.com/banacorn/agda-mode-st3), [eclipse](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b7f9/32609298debd21398d54e13c864e26a03ac1.pdf).

## Useful Agda-mode commands

```markdown
C-c C-l   load (type checking)
C-c C-f   forward (jump to next hole)
C-c C-b   backward (jump to previous hole)
C-c C-d   deduce (type of expression)
C-c C-n   normalize (evaluate expression)
```

```markdown
Commands inside a hole
C-c C-,   information about the hole
C-c C-d   deduce (type of contents of hole)
C-c C-Space   give (checks whether the term in the hole has the right type and if it has, replaces the hole with the term)
C-c C-c   case split (pattern match on variables)
C-c C-r   refine (one step further)
C-c C-a   auto (try to find a solution)
```

Agda-mode for emacs can be installed using

```bash
agda-mode setup
```

This entire project can be loaded into emacs like:

```bash
emacs ./contents.lagda.md
```

followed by loading `agda-mode` by typing `space` `space` `agda-mode`. Using [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) is recommended.
