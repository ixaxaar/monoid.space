# Functions

A function `𝕗` which takes a value of type `𝔸` and returns a value of type `𝔹`, is said to be of type `𝔸 → 𝔹` and is written as `𝕗 : 𝔸 → 𝔹`. The type `𝔸` is called the function `𝕗`'s "domain" and `𝔹` is the "co-domain".

```agda
{-# OPTIONS --allow-unsolved-metas #-}

module Lang.functions where

open import Lang.dataStructures hiding (_+_)
```

## Generic Syntax

Syntax for defining functions in Agda:

1. Define name and type of function
2. Define clauses for each applicable pattern

```haskell
-- 1. Name (not), Type (Bool → Bool)
not : Bool → Bool
-- 2. Clause 1: if the argument to `not` is `true`
not true = false
-- 2. Clause 2: if the argument to `not` is `false`
not false = true
```

## Examples - Pattern matching functions

### The Logical Not

The simplest of functions simply match patterns. For example the function for `not`:

```agda
not : Bool → Bool
not true = false -- return false if we are given a true
not false = true -- return a true if we are given a false
```

we could also use a wildcard type (`_`) like this:

```agda
not₁ : Bool → Bool
not₁ true = false -- return false if we are given a true
not₁ _ = true -- return true in all other cases
```

### The logical AND

In Agda, function names containing `_`s indicate those functions can behave as operators. Hence `_+_` indicates that instead of calling the functions `+(a, b)` one can call it as `a + b`, whereas `if_then_else_` can be called as `if condition then 2 else 3`.

One has to also define whether the infix operator is left or right associative (`infixl`, `infixr`) and its precedence level. The default precedence level for a newly defined operator is 20.

```agda
_∧_ : Bool → Bool → Bool
true ∧ whatever = whatever -- true AND whatever is whatever
false ∧ whatever = false -- false AND whatever is false

infixr 6 _∧_
```

### The logical OR

```agda
_∨_ : Bool → Bool → Bool
true ∨ whatever = true -- true or whatever is true
false ∨ whatever = whatever -- false or whatever is whatever

infixr 6 _∨_
```

These functions can be applied as:

```agda
notTrue : Bool
notTrue = not true

false₁ : Bool
false₁ = true ∧ false

true₁ : Bool
true₁ = true ∨ false ∨ false₁
```

## Examples - Recursive functions

### Addition of natural numbers

Here we follow a similar pattern as in `data`, we define:

- the identity condition, what happens on addition with zero in this case
- and how to successively build up the final value

```agda
_+_ : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
zero + n = n
succ m + n = succ (m + n)

infixl 6 _+_
```
Thus, we can use them to get new numbers easily:

```agda
eleven = ten + one
twelve = eleven + one
thirteen = twelve + one
```

### Length of a List

The length of a list consists of traversing through the list and adding one for each element:

```agda
length : List ⊤ → ℕ
length [] = zero
length (x :: xs) = one + (length xs)
```

# Dependent Function Types or Π-types

Similar to dependent pair types, a dependent function type is a function type whose result type depends upon its argument value. The notation in type theory looks like this for binary dependent function types:

$$
\prod_{x : A} B(x)
$$

with ternary dependent pair types being represented as:

$$
\prod_{x : A} \prod_{y : B(x)} C(y)
$$

and so on.

## Lambda Functions

Lambda or anonymous functions can be defined using the following syntax:

```agda
example₁ = \ (A : Set)(x : A) → x
```

and a more concise syntax:

```lagda
example₂ = λ A x → x
```

Note that `\` and `λ` can be used interchangeably.

Following are a few examples of functions:

## Examples

### Implicit Arguments: List concatenation

Functions in Agda can work with implicit parameters. For example, instead of having the specify the type of `A`, the compiler can be expected to figure it out. Hence instead of defining `_++_ : (A : Set) → List A → List A → List A`, we define it like:

```agda
_++_ : {A : Set} → List A → List A → List A
[]        ++ ys = ys
(x :: xs) ++ ys = x :: (xs ++ ys)

infixr 5 _++_
```

Note that the curly braces `{}` are "implicit arguments" in Agda. Values of implicit arguments are derived from other arguments' (in this case `List A`) values and types by solving type equations. You don’t have to apply them or pattern match on them explicitly (though they can be explicitly passed like `function_name{A = A}`).

This function takes a type as a parameter `A`, and hence can work on `List`s of any type `A`. This feature of functions is called "parametric polymorphism".

### Dot patterns: Square

A dot pattern (also called inaccessible pattern) can be used when the only type-correct value of the argument is determined by the patterns given for the other arguments. The syntax for a dot pattern is `.t`.

As an example, consider the datatype `Square` defined as follows:

```agda
data Square : ℕ → Set where
  sq : (m : ℕ) → Square (m × m)
```

Suppose we want to define a function `root : (n : ℕ) → Square n → ℕ` that takes as its arguments a number `n` and a proof that it is a square, and returns the square root of that number. We can do so as follows:

```agda
root : (n : ℕ) → Square n → ℕ
root .(m × m) (sq m) = m
```

### Map

We implement the `map` function, of "map-reduce" fame, for `List`s:
A map function for a `List` is a function that applies a lambda (un-named) function to all elements of a `List`.

If `f` were a lambda function, map-ing `f` over `List(a, b, c, d)` would produce `List(f(a), f(b), f(c), f(d))`

![Figure 1: Map](../artwork/map.png)

```agda
map : {A B : Set} → List A → (A → B) → List B
map [] f = []
map (x :: xs) f = (f x) :: (map xs f)
```

Here, we apply the function `addOne` to a list, using `map`:

```agda
addOne : ℕ → ℕ
addOne x  = x + one

oneAdded : List ℕ
oneAdded = map (one :: two :: three :: four :: []) addOne
```

# Syntactical Sugar

```haskell
prop₁ : ((x : A) (y : B) → C) is-the-same-as   ((x : A) → (y : B) → C)
prop₂ : ((x y : A) → C)       is-the-same-as   ((x : A)(y : A) → C)
prop₃ : (forall (x : A) → C)  is-the-same-as   ((x : A) → C)
prop₄ : (forall x → C)        is-the-same-as   ((x : _) → C)
prop₅ : (forall x y → C)      is-the-same-as   (forall x → forall y → C)
(\x y → e)                    is-the-same-as   (\x → (\y → e))
(f a b)                       is-the-same-as   ((f a) b)
```
