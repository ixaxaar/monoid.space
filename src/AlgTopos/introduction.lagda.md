# Algebraic Topology

In mathematics, Topology is concerned with the properties of a geometric object that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching, twisting, crumpling and bending, but not tearing or gluing. The main object of study is also called a "Topological Space" and the deformations "Homeomorphism" and "Homotopy". Generally well-known geometric objects as well as metric spaces (like the 3-D real space we live in and experience) are all examples of topological spaces.

The branch of Algebraic Topology is the study of the properties of Topological Spaces and continuous maps or Homeomorphisms between them using the tools of abstract algebra. The properties of spaces studied are ones which are invariant to continuous transformations (Homeomorphisms). The primary properties of spaces, which also help in classifying the spaces into various types include:

1. Homotopy
2. Homology
3. Cohomology

Algebraic Topology also studies special kinds of spaces, major ones being:

1. Manifolds
2. Knots
3. Simplical Complexes

We first start with basics of topology where we see what we exactly mean by Topological Spaces, Homeomorphisms and Homotopies. We then take a look at applying algebraic structures to studying Topology and try to cover some important concepts.
