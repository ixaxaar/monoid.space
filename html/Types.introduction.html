<h2 id="foundations-of-mathematics">Foundations of Mathematics</h2>
<p>At the very base of mathematics, we have the concept of sets, which are collections of objects. Set theory provides a
formal language for defining and manipulating these collections. Set theory forms the programming language of
mathematics, allowing us to express mathematical concepts and operations in a precise and unambiguous way. All
mathematical structures can be built from sets, and all machinery operating on these structures can be expressed in
terms of set operations. Mathematics is built on a foundation of axioms and rules that define the basic concepts and
operations used in mathematical reasoning. These foundations provide a framework for proving theorems and establishing
the validity of mathematical results.</p>
<p>Set theory, however, is not the only foundational system for mathematics. Over the past century, another foundational
system has emerged: type theory. Type theory is a formal system that classifies mathematical objects by their types and
specifies valid operations on these objects. In type theory, every mathematical object has a type, and types serve
multiple roles, such as classifying objects, specifying operations, catching errors, and representing propositions. Type
theory provides a different perspective on mathematics, emphasizing the structure of mathematical objects and the
relationships between them.</p>
<p>While both set theory and type theory can serve as foundations for mathematics, they approach mathematical reasoning
in fundamentally different ways. Lean, like several other modern proof assistants, is based on type theory. This choice
enables Lean to provide powerful tools for both mathematical reasoning and computation. Practically, using Lean, and
hence type theory, instead of set theory implies we can automatically check proofs, instead of the ultra-tedious manual
checking that would be required in set theory. This is because Lean‚Äôs type theory is designed to be computable, which
means that we can write programs that manipulate proofs and terms. This is a significant advantage over set theory,
where proofs are typically written in natural language and must be checked manually by humans, who tend to make their
own mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="set-theory-fundamentals">Set Theory Fundamentals</h2>
<p>In set theory, mathematical objects are sets. Here we cover the very basics of sets and their operations.</p>
<h3 id="construction">Construction</h3>
<p>Sets can be constructed by enumerating their elements. For example, <code>x</code> is a set containing the natural
numbers 1, 2, and 3:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def y : Set Nat := {1, 2, 3}    -- y is the set {1, 2, 3}</code></pre>
<p>Sets can also be constructed by the builder notation {x | P x}, where P x is a predicate that specifies the objects
that belong to the set. For example, <code>x</code> is a set of natural numbers greater than 0:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def x : Set Nat := {n | n &gt; 0}  -- x is the set of natural numbers greater than 0</code></pre>
<h3 id="membership-and-subsets">Membership and Subsets</h3>
<p>Set membership is denoted by the symbol ‚àà. It implies that an object, <code>x</code>, belongs to a set, for example
here <code>x</code> belongs to the set of natural numbers <code>Nat</code>:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def x : Set Nat := {n | n &gt; 0}  -- x is the set of natural numbers greater than 0</code></pre>
<p>Subsets are denoted by the symbol ‚äÜ. It implies that a set, <code>y</code>, is a subset of another set,
<code>x</code>:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def y : Set Nat := {n | n &gt; 1}  -- y is the set of natural numbers greater than 1
def z : Bool := y ‚äÜ x           -- z is true because y is a subset of x</code></pre>
<h3 id="set-operations">Set Operations</h3>
<p>Sets can be combined using set operations. For example, the union of two sets <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is a
set containing all elements that belong to either <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def x : Set Nat := {1, 2, 3}    -- x is the set {1, 2, 3}
def y : Set Nat := {3, 4, 5}    -- y is the set {3, 4, 5}

def z : Set Nat := x ‚à™ y        -- z is the union of x and y</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the intersection of two sets <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is a set containing all elements that
belong to both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z : Set Nat := x ‚à© y        -- z is the intersection of x and y</code></pre>
<p>Sets can have complements, which are the elements that do not belong to the set:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z : Set Nat := x·∂ú          -- z is the complement of x</code></pre>
<p>There is a special set, the empty set, denoted by ‚àÖ, which contains no elements:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z : Set Nat := ‚àÖ            -- z is the empty set</code></pre>
<p>and power sets, which are sets of all subsets of a given set:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z : Set (Set Nat) := ùí´ x    -- z is the power set of x</code></pre>
<h3 id="properties-of-set-operations">Properties of Set Operations</h3>
<p>The operations on sets have several properties. For example, the following properties hold for union and
intersection:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Commutativity: The order of sets does not matter for union and intersection:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lean"><code>def x : Set Nat := {1, 2, 3}
def y : Set Nat := {3, 4, 5}

#check x ‚à™ y -- Set Nat
#check y ‚à™ x -- Set Nat</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(z_{1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(z_{2}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z_{3}\)</span> are equivalent.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Associativity: The grouping of sets does not matter for union and intersection:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z : Set Nat := {5, 6, 7}

#check x ‚à™ (y ‚à™ z) -- Set Nat
#check (x ‚à™ y) ‚à™ z -- Set Nat</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(z_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_{2}\)</span> are equivalent.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Distributivity: Union and intersection distribute over each other:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lean"><code>#check x ‚à™ (y ‚à© z)
#check (x ‚à™ y) ‚à© (x ‚à™ z)</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(z_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_{2}\)</span> are equivalent.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Idempotence: Repeated union or intersection with the same set does not change the set:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lean"><code>#check x ‚à™ x
#check x ‚à© x</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(z_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_{2}\)</span> are equivalent to
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Identity: The empty set is the identity for union and the universal set is the identity for intersection:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z‚ÇÅ : Set Nat := x ‚à™ ‚àÖ
def z‚ÇÇ : Set Nat := x ‚à© {n | n &gt; 0}</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(z_{1}\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z_{2}\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Distributivity of union over intersection: Union operation distributes over intersection:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z‚ÇÅ : Set Nat := x ‚à™ (y ‚à© z)
def z‚ÇÇ : Set Nat := (x ‚à™ y) ‚à© (x ‚à™ z)</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(z_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_{2}\)</span> are equivalent.</p>
<p>There are several other properties of set operations, which are used in mathematical reasoning and proofs, and we are
going to skip those as styduing them is not the goal of this book.</p>
<h2 id="type-theory-fundamentals">Type Theory Fundamentals</h2>
<h3 id="types-and-terms">Types and Terms</h3>
<p>The fundamental concept in type theory is that every mathematical object has a type. We write this using a colon:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def x : Nat := 5        -- x has type Nat (natural number)
def b : Bool := true    -- b has type Bool (boolean)</code></pre>
<p>A <code>Type</code> in mathematics and computer science is a collection of objects that share common properties. In
type theory, types classify mathematical objects and specify valid operations on them. For example, the type
<code>Nat</code> represents the set of natural numbers, and the type <code>Bool</code> represents the set of boolean
values. Types can also represent propositions, as we will see later.</p>
<p>Types serve multiple roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>They classify mathematical objects, as in all objects of a type share common properties.</li>
<li>They specify valid operations on objects of a type.</li>
<li>They can represent propositions (the propositions-as-types principle).</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, a ‚Äútheory‚Äù in mathematics can be constructed using type theory by defining the types of objects in the
theory and the operations that can be performed on them. This is similar to how a ‚Äútheory‚Äù in set theory can be
constructed by defining the sets of objects in the theory and the operations that can be performed on them.</p>
<p>A term is an object of a type. For example, <code>5</code> is a term of type <code>Nat</code>, and <code>true</code>
is a term of type <code>Bool</code>. Terms can be combined using operations defined on their types. For example, we can
add two natural numbers:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def x : Nat := 5
def y : Nat := 10
def z : Nat := x + y</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>z</code> is a term of type <code>Nat</code> obtained by adding <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p>
<h3 id="judgments">Judgments</h3>
<p>Judgements are statements about types and terms in type theory. They are used to define what constitutes a valid
type, a valid term of a type, and when two types or terms are considered equal. Type theory works with several kinds of
judgments:</p>
<h4 id="type-formation-defines-what-constitutes-a-valid-type">1. Type Formation: Defines what constitutes a valid
type</h4>
<pre class="lean"><code>#check Nat        -- Nat : Type
#check Bool       -- Bool : Type</code></pre>
<p>Formally, a type is a valid type if it is a member of the universe of types.</p>
<h4 id="term-formation-defines-valid-terms-of-a-type">2. Term Formation: Defines valid terms of a type</h4>
<pre class="lean"><code>def valid_nat : Nat := 42
-- This would fail: def invalid_nat : Nat := true</code></pre>
<p>Formally, a term is a valid term of a type if it is a member of the set of terms of that type. Consider the type
<code>Nat</code> as the set of natural numbers. Then, <code>42</code> is a valid term of type <code>Nat</code>, while
<code>true</code> is not.</p>
<h4 id="type-equality-when-two-types-are-considered-the-same">3. Type Equality: When two types are considered the
same</h4>
<p>Lean provides a way to state basic equalities using <code>=</code>. We have the principle that every value is equal
to itself: which is the principle of reflexivity.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>#check 2 + 2 = 4</code></pre>
<p>The <code>rfl</code> tactic stands for ‚Äúreflexivity.‚Äù It allows Lean to acknowledge this simple kind of equality,
where something is clearly equal to itself <em>by definition</em>:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>example : 2 + 2 = 4 := rfl  -- 2 + 2 reduces to 4 definitionally.</code></pre>
<p><code>rfl</code> proofs that the two sides of the equality (<code>=</code>) are definitionally equal.</p>
<p>There are three kinds of equality in type theory:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definitional Equality</strong>: Equality by definition (what Lean‚Äôs #reduce shows).</li>
<li><strong>Propositional Equality</strong>: Equality expressed as a proposition (the = we‚Äôve been using). This kind of
equality is non-trivial and needs to be proved.</li>
<li><strong>Judgmental Equality</strong>: A lower-level notion of equality that is built into Lean‚Äôs type checker.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="term-equality-when-two-terms-are-considered-equal">4. Term Equality: When two terms are considered equal</h4>
<pre class="lean"><code>example : 2 + 2 = 4 := rfl  -- rfl proves equality by definition</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>rfl</code> is a proof that <code>2 + 2</code> is equal to <code>4</code>, where <code>rfl</code> denotes
reflexivity property of equality which states that every term is equal to itself, or if <code>x</code> is equal to
<code>y</code>, then <code>y</code> is equal to <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>We will further explore type theory in the following sections.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
<h3 id="computer-science">Computer Science</h3>

</ol>
<h3 id="mathematics">Mathematics</h3>
<p>While Set Theory remains the most common foundation for mathematics, Type Theory offers some advantages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Constructive Mathematics</strong>: Type Theory naturally supports constructive approaches to
mathematics.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Computational Content</strong>: Proofs in Type Theory often have direct computational
interpretations.</p></li>

expressive than first-order logic used in Set Theory.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Homotopy Type Theory</strong>: Recent developments have connected Type Theory with modern areas of
mathematics like homotopy theory.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="advanced-concepts-and-implications">Advanced Concepts and Implications</h2>
<h3 id="categorical-interpretations">Categorical Interpretations</h3>
<p>Both Set Theory and Type Theory have important connections to Category Theory, a branch of mathematics that deals
with abstract structures and relationships between them.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Set Theory and Categories</strong>:
<ul>
<li>The category Set, whose objects are sets and morphisms are functions, is a fundamental example in category
theory.</li>
<li>Many set-theoretic constructions have categorical generalizations (e.g., products, coproducts, exponentials).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Type Theory and Categories</strong>:
<ul>
<li>There‚Äôs a deep connection between Type Theory and Cartesian closed categories.</li>
<li>Each type theory gives rise to a category, where types are objects and terms are morphisms.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="homotopy-type-theory">Homotopy Type Theory</h3>
<p>Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) is a recent development that connects Type Theory with abstract homotopy theory.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Univalence Axiom</strong>: This axiom in HoTT states that isomorphic types are equal, providing a
powerful principle for reasoning about equivalence.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inductive Types with Recursion</strong>: HoTT extends Type Theory with inductive types and recursion
principles, allowing for the construction of complex structures like higher inductive types.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="proof-assistants-and-formal-verification">Proof Assistants and Formal Verification</h3>
<p>The development of proof assistants based on Type Theory has significant implications for mathematics and computer
science.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Formalized Mathematics</strong>: Large parts of mathematics have been formalized in systems like Coq,
Lean, and Agda, and is the basic reason why we are here!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software Verification</strong>: Type Theory-based systems are used to verify the correctness of critical
software systems.</p></li>
