<h2 id="foundations-of-mathematics">Foundations of Mathematics</h2>
<p>At the very base of mathematics, we have the concept of sets, which are collections of objects. Set theory provides a
formal language for defining and manipulating these collections. Set theory forms the programming language of
mathematics, allowing us to express mathematical concepts and operations in a precise and unambiguous way. All
mathematical structures can be built from sets, and all machinery operating on these structures can be expressed in
terms of set operations. Mathematics is built on a foundation of axioms and rules that define the basic concepts and
operations used in mathematical reasoning. These foundations provide a framework for proving theorems and establishing
the validity of mathematical results.</p>
<p>Set theory, however, is not the only foundational system for mathematics. Over the past century, another foundational
system has emerged: type theory. Type theory is a formal system that classifies mathematical objects by their types and
specifies valid operations on these objects. In type theory, every mathematical object has a type, and types serve
multiple roles, such as classifying objects, specifying operations, catching errors, and representing propositions. Type
theory provides a different perspective on mathematics, emphasizing the structure of mathematical objects and the
relationships between them.</p>
<p>While both set theory and type theory can serve as foundations for mathematics, they approach mathematical reasoning
in fundamentally different ways. Lean, like several other modern proof assistants, is based on type theory. This choice
enables Lean to provide powerful tools for both mathematical reasoning and computation. Practically, using Lean, and
hence type theory, instead of set theory implies we can automatically check proofs, instead of the ultra-tedious manual
checking that would be required in set theory. This is because Lean‚Äôs type theory is designed to be computable, which
means that we can write programs that manipulate proofs and terms. This is a significant advantage over set theory,
where proofs are typically written in natural language and must be checked manually by humans, who tend to make their
own mistakes.</p>
<h2 id="set-theory">Set Theory</h2>
<p>In set theory, mathematical objects are sets. Here we cover the very basics of sets and their operations.</p>
<h3 id="construction">Construction</h3>
<p>Sets can be constructed by enumerating their elements. For example, <code>x</code> is a set containing the natural
numbers 1, 2, and 3:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def y : Set Nat := {1, 2, 3}    -- y is the set {1, 2, 3}</code></pre>
<p>Sets can also be constructed by the builder notation {x | P x}, where P x is a predicate that specifies the objects
that belong to the set. For example, <code>x</code> is a set of natural numbers greater than 0:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def x : Set Nat := {n | n &gt; 0}  -- x is the set of natural numbers greater than 0</code></pre>
<h3 id="membership-and-subsets">Membership and Subsets</h3>
<p>Set membership is denoted by the symbol ‚àà. It implies that an object, <code>x</code>, belongs to a set, for example
here <code>x</code> belongs to the set of natural numbers <code>Nat</code>:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def x : Set Nat := {n | n &gt; 0}  -- x is the set of natural numbers greater than 0</code></pre>
<p>Subsets are denoted by the symbol ‚äÜ. It implies that a set, <code>y</code>, is a subset of another set,
<code>x</code>:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def y : Set Nat := {n | n &gt; 1}  -- y is the set of natural numbers greater than 1
def z : Bool := y ‚äÜ x           -- z is true because y is a subset of x</code></pre>
<h3 id="set-operations">Set Operations</h3>
<p>Sets can be combined using set operations. For example, the union of two sets <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is a
set containing all elements that belong to either <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def x : Set Nat := {1, 2, 3}    -- x is the set {1, 2, 3}
def y : Set Nat := {3, 4, 5}    -- y is the set {3, 4, 5}

def z : Set Nat := x ‚à™ y        -- z is the union of x and y</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, the intersection of two sets <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> is a set containing all elements that
belong to both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z : Set Nat := x ‚à© y        -- z is the intersection of x and y</code></pre>
<p>Sets can have complements, which are the elements that do not belong to the set:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z : Set Nat := x·∂ú          -- z is the complement of x</code></pre>
<p>There is a special set, the empty set, denoted by ‚àÖ, which contains no elements:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z : Set Nat := ‚àÖ            -- z is the empty set</code></pre>
<p>and power sets, which are sets of all subsets of a given set:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z : Set (Set Nat) := ùí´ x    -- z is the power set of x</code></pre>
<h3 id="properties-of-set-operations">Properties of Set Operations</h3>
<p>The operations on sets have several properties. For example, the following properties hold for union and
intersection:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Commutativity: The order of sets does not matter for union and intersection:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lean"><code>def x : Set Nat := {1, 2, 3}
def y : Set Nat := {3, 4, 5}

#check x ‚à™ y -- Set Nat
#check y ‚à™ x -- Set Nat</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(z_{1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(z_{2}\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(z_{3}\)</span> are equivalent.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Associativity: The grouping of sets does not matter for union and intersection:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z : Set Nat := {5, 6, 7}

#check x ‚à™ (y ‚à™ z) -- Set Nat
#check (x ‚à™ y) ‚à™ z -- Set Nat</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(z_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_{2}\)</span> are equivalent.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Distributivity: Union and intersection distribute over each other:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lean"><code>#check x ‚à™ (y ‚à© z)
#check (x ‚à™ y) ‚à© (x ‚à™ z)</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(z_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_{2}\)</span> are equivalent.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Idempotence: Repeated union or intersection with the same set does not change the set:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lean"><code>#check x ‚à™ x
#check x ‚à© x</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(z_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_{2}\)</span> are equivalent to
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Identity: The empty set is the identity for union and the universal set is the identity for intersection:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z‚ÇÅ : Set Nat := x ‚à™ ‚àÖ
def z‚ÇÇ : Set Nat := x ‚à© {n | n &gt; 0}</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(z_{1}\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(z_{2}\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Distributivity of union over intersection: Union operation distributes over intersection:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lean"><code>def z‚ÇÅ : Set Nat := x ‚à™ (y ‚à© z)
def z‚ÇÇ : Set Nat := (x ‚à™ y) ‚à© (x ‚à™ z)</code></pre>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(z_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_{2}\)</span> are equivalent.</p>
<p>Additional properties of set operations exist and are fundamental to mathematical reasoning, but we omit them as they
fall outside this book‚Äôs scope.</p>
<h2 id="type-theory">Type Theory</h2>
<p>Type theory provides an alternative foundation for mathematics and computer science, distinct from set theory. Rather
than constructing everything from sets, type theory centers on the concept of types, with the fundamental principle that
every object has a type. This computational emphasis makes type theory well-suited for formal verification and automated
proof checking, as implemented in proof assistants like Lean.</p>
<h3 id="types-terms-and-judgments">Types, Terms, and Judgments</h3>
<p>The core building blocks of type theory are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types:</strong> These represent collections of objects with shared properties. Think of familiar examples
like <code>Nat</code> (natural numbers) or <code>Bool</code> (booleans). But types can be much more sophisticated,
representing functions, propositions, and complex data structures.</li>
<li><strong>Terms:</strong> These are the individual objects that inhabit types. For example, <code>5</code> is a term
of type <code>Nat</code>, and <code>true</code> is a term of type <code>Bool</code>. We use the notation
<code>a : A</code> to say that term <code>a</code> has type <code>A</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Judgments:</strong> These are the fundamental assertions we make within type theory. They are <em>not</em>
propositions that can be true or false within the system; instead, they are declarations about the validity of types and
terms. There are four main kinds of judgments:</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="type-formation">Type Formation</h3>
<p>This judgment asserts that something is a well-formed type. In Lean:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>#check Nat        -- Nat : Type
#check Bool       -- Bool : Type
#check Nat ‚Üí Bool  -- Nat ‚Üí Bool : Type (Functions from Nat to Bool)</code></pre>
<p>Formally, the judgment <code>A : Type</code> (or sometimes <code>A type</code>, depending on the specific type
theory) means that <code>A</code> is a valid type. This is not something you prove within the system; it‚Äôs a
foundational assertion established by rules. The notation <code>#check</code> will only succeed for well formed
types.</p>
<h3 id="term-formation">Term Formation</h3>
<p>This judgment asserts that a term belongs to a specific type:</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>#check (5 : Nat)      -- 5 : Nat
#check (true : Bool)   -- true : Bool

def myNumber : Nat := 5
#check myNumber       -- myNumber : Nat

-- Example of an ill-typed term (this would cause an error):
-- def badNumber : Nat := true  -- Error: type mismatch</code></pre>
<p>Formally, <code>a : A</code> means ‚Äúterm <code>a</code> has type <code>A</code>‚Äù. Again, this is not a proposition to
be proven, but a declaration based on the rules of type theory. Lean‚Äôs type checker enforces these rules. If you try to
construct a term that violates the typing rules, Lean will report an error.</p>
<h3 id="type-equality">Type Equality</h3>
<p>This judgment asserts that two types are definitionally equal. This is a very strong form of equality. It means they
are the same type, not just equivalent in some way. This is often written as <code>A ‚â° B</code> or (in some contexts)
just <code>A = B</code> (but be careful ‚Äì in a type theory, equality can mean different things). Lean handles
definitional equality internally.</p>
<pre class="lean"><code>-- Example (though Lean infers this automatically)
def MyType : Type := Nat
#check MyType -- MyType : Type, which is definitionally equal to Nat.</code></pre>
<p>In this simple case, the type <code>MyType</code> on the right hand side is defined as equal to the <code>Nat</code>.
With a simple equality, this is a <em>definitional equality</em>. Other examples are provided below.</p>
<h3 id="term-equality">Term Equality</h3>
<p>This judgment has two main forms, with critical distinctions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Definitional Equality (‚â°):</strong> Two terms are definitionally equal if they reduce to the same normal
form. This is like saying <code>2 + 2</code> and <code>4</code> are definitionally equal. Lean checks this
automatically.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lean"><code>example : 2 + 2 = 4 := rfl  -- Success!  2 + 2 and 4 are definitionally equal.</code></pre>
<p><code>rfl</code> (reflexivity) works precisely because <code>2 + 2</code> and <code>4</code> are
<em>definitionally</em> equal. Lean can see this directly, without further proof steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Propositional Equality (=):</strong> This is the more familiar notion of equality, expressed as a
<em>proposition</em> that can be proven. <code>a = b</code> (where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are terms of the
same type) is itself a <em>type</em>! This is where the <em>propositions-as-types</em> principle comes in (which we‚Äôll
cover later, but it‚Äôs good to be aware of it early). Proving <code>a = b</code> involves constructing a <em>term</em> of
that type.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lean"><code>-- An easy example, still provable by rfl because of definitional equality
example : (2 + 2 : Nat) = (4 : Nat) := rfl

-- A slightly more interesting example, requiring a proof (using theorems)
example (n : Nat) : n + 0 = n := Nat.add_zero n</code></pre>
<p>Crucially, definitional equality implies propositional equality, but <em>not</em> the other way around. If
<code>a ‚â° b</code>, then <code>a = b</code> is trivially provable (with <code>rfl</code>).</p>
<h3 id="advantages-of-type-theory">Advantages of Type Theory</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Computability:</strong> Type theory is inherently computational. Terms can be evaluated, and type checking
is a decidable process.</li>
<li><strong>Formal Verification:</strong> This computability makes type theory ideal for formalizing mathematics and
verifying the correctness of computer programs. Proof assistants like Lean are built on type theory.</li>
<li><strong>Expressiveness:</strong> Type theory can express complex mathematical concepts in a natural and concise
way.</li>
<li><strong>Propositions as Types:</strong> A key concept (to be explored later) is that propositions (statements that
can be true or false) can also be treated as types. This creates a powerful connection between logic and
computation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<h4 id="computer-science">Computer Science</h4>
<p>Type Theory has found extensive applications in computer science:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Programming Language Design</strong>: Many modern programming languages incorporate ideas from Type Theory
in their type systems.</li>
<li><strong>Formal Verification</strong>: Type Theory provides a basis for proving properties of programs and verifying
their correctness.</li>
<li><strong>Proof Assistants</strong>: Software like Coq, Agda, and Lean, based on Type Theory, allow for
computer-assisted theorem proving.</li>
<li><strong>Foundations of Computer Science</strong>: Type Theory provides a theoretical foundation for understanding
computation and programming languages.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="mathematics">Mathematics</h4>
<p>While Set Theory remains the most common foundation for mathematics, Type Theory offers some advantages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Constructive Mathematics</strong>: Type Theory naturally supports constructive approaches to
mathematics.</li>
<li><strong>Computational Content</strong>: Proofs in Type Theory often have direct computational interpretations.</li>
<li><strong>Higher-Order Logic</strong>: Type Theory easily accommodates higher-order logic, which can be more
expressive than first-order logic used in Set Theory.</li>
<li><strong>Homotopy Type Theory</strong>: Recent developments have connected Type Theory with modern areas of
mathematics like homotopy theory.</li>
